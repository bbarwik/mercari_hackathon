Do you have powerful gaming PC? Are you not using it all the time? Share it with others and earn some money!
We are going to create game sharing (via streaming) platform. 

We will use c, c++, html, css, javascript and python. 
Hardest part will be to implementation and application with vnc optimized for gpu (it's almost not possible to do real time video compression on cpu).

More informations soon, if you want to talk about idea, we are close to main screen, from left side (viewer perspective).
